### New Features
- Successful response status codes made customizable. Defaults to 200-299. 
- More information given to decodeError.
- Examples improved

### Breaking Change
- Typo correction: The property `unautherizedStatusCode` has been renamed to `unauthorizedStatusCode`.  
    - **Action required:** If you have overridden this property in your custom `NetworkRequest` subclasses, update your code to use the new name. If not, no changes are needed.

- `headers` field in `NetworkRequest` made private to avoid any unintended behaviour. It is no longer accessible for subclasses.

- `decodeError` parameters have changed to send CapturedResponse instead of dynamic.
    - **How to resolve:**  
        Previously, you may have implemented.  
         ```dart
        Exception? errorDecoder(dynamic data) {
            // ...your logic here
        }
        ```
        Now, update your method to:  
        ```dart
        Exception? errorDecoder(CapturedResponse response) {
            var data = response.body;
            // ...your logic here
        }
        ```
        This change gives you access to the full response object, so use `response.body` to access the data as before.
